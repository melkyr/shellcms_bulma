## shellCMS_bulma

shellCMS_bulma is a static site generator Content Management System (CMS) based on the original shellCMS by Barry Kauler, with several modifications to support modern web development practices.

This repository is a fork of the [shellCMS](https://github.com/bkauler/woofq/tree/main/easyos/easy-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/local/shellcms) project, developed by [Barry Kauler](https://bkhome.org/shellcms/index.html) and based on the [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) project.

### Modifications

The modifications included shellCMS_bulma include:

    The bash file has been renamed to shellcms_b
    Internal classes have been modified to work with the Bulma CSS framework
    Added support for page SVG icons
    The option to have a SVG-picture banner instead of a top-banner.png
    Custom posts with responsive content while keeping all the benefits from the original shellCMS
    Added support for gum / dialog for interactive prompts through -i and -igum switches
    
Besides we have also the original benefits of shellCMS

    Scales efficiently to large sites
    Completely static HTML pages
    Create and edit pages with WYSIWYG HTML editor
    Any number of shellCMS_b installations on the same site
    Documentation and blog modes
    ShellCMS_b is a small bash shell script
    Develop locally, upload with rsync
    Extremely easy to use
    Optional Disqus and Twitter blog comments
    Supports Bulma CSS framework
    Supports page SVG icons
    Supports custom SVG picture banners

### Usage

    Download or clone the repository.
    Modify the config.conf file to customize the site settings, such as the site name and description, banner, and social media links.
    Place your custom SVG picture banner in the images0 folder, and edit the script to replace both your blog title and your short description.
    Place your page SVG icons in the icons folder.
    Although the use a WYSIWYG HTML editor, such as SeaMonkey Composer, to create and edit pages is supported to have better control of changes a tag based editor such as geany, vscode, helix is recommended.
    To publish your site, run the shellcms_b script in the root folder of your site. The script generates the static HTML pages, which you can upload to your web server using rsync or uploading manually your files.

Advantages of a static site

    Security: Static sites are very secure because they do not require server-side scripting or database connections, which are often targets for cyber attacks. In contrast, dynamic sites with server-side scripting and database connections can be more vulnerable to security breaches.

    Low server load: Static sites are generated and stored as simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on a server. This means that they require very little server processing power to serve up to visitors, which can result in significant cost savings for website owners.

    Fast page loading: Because static sites are simple HTML files that don't require complex server-side processing, they typically load much faster than dynamic sites. This means that visitors to a static site will generally experience faster page load times, resulting in a better user experience.

    Already archived: Because static sites are essentially just collections of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, they can be easily archived and stored on other servers or services. This means that even if the original site goes offline, visitors can still access a cached version of the site, which can be useful for research or historical purposes.

As there is no database, your site is "already archived" on your local PC. You can easily move your site to another remote host by uploading the files to it.

### Requirements

ShellCMS_b runs on any operating system that can run bash. Almost all Linux distributions come with bash preinstalled. Mac also supports bash, but it is not tested. If you are a Windows user, you can boot up a Linux distribution from a USB flash drive (for now). We recommend Puppy Linux or EasyOS, which come with SeaMonkey pre-installed. Alternatively, you can use other WYSIWYG HTML editors or a text editor.
